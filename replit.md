# Code Architect AI - Backend Builder

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application that uses AI to generate production-ready backend code. Users can describe what they want to build in natural language, and the AI architect creates complete applications with all necessary files, database schemas, and deployment configurations.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui styling
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and bundling

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Pattern**: RESTful API with WebSocket support for real-time features
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o for code generation and chat responses

### Database Design
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (via Neon serverless)
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations
- **Connection**: Connection pooling with @neondatabase/serverless

## Key Components

### Core Database Tables
- **users**: User authentication and profile management
- **projects**: Project metadata, status tracking, and configuration
- **chatSessions**: Conversation threads between users and AI
- **chatMessages**: Individual messages with metadata for AI responses
- **generatedFiles**: Code files generated by AI with project associations

### Frontend Pages
- **Index**: Landing page with feature overview and call-to-action
- **Dashboard**: Project overview with statistics and quick actions
- **Chat**: Real-time AI conversation interface for code generation
- **Projects**: Project management with templates and file browsing

### AI Integration
- **Code Generation**: Structured prompts that return JSON with files, actions, and explanations
- **Real-time Chat**: WebSocket-based communication for immediate AI responses
- **File Management**: Generated code files are stored and can be downloaded or deployed

## Data Flow

1. **User Request**: User describes their backend requirements in the chat interface
2. **AI Processing**: OpenAI processes the request and generates structured code responses
3. **File Generation**: AI creates complete file structures with explanations
4. **Storage**: Generated files and chat history are stored in PostgreSQL
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections provide immediate feedback during generation
6. **Project Management**: Users can manage multiple projects and their generated files

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL database connection
- **openai**: AI code generation and chat responses
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database operations
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible UI component primitives
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management

### Development Tools
- **vite**: Frontend build tool and development server
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for development
- **esbuild**: Backend bundling for production
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Frontend served by Vite development server with HMR
- Backend runs with tsx for TypeScript execution
- Database migrations managed through Drizzle Kit
- Real-time error overlay for development debugging

### Production Build
- Frontend: Static files built with Vite and served by Express
- Backend: Bundled with esbuild as ESM modules
- Database: Serverless PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- Environment: Designed for deployment on platforms like Replit, Vercel, or similar

### Key Features
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Fast development iteration
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage across frontend and backend
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket support for instant AI responses
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with adaptive layouts
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback
- **Session Management**: Persistent chat sessions and project state
